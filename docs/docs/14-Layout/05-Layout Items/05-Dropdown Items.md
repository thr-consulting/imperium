Dropdown layout items will render their children as dropdown menus. You cannot include dropdown or submenu items as children.

## dropdown
These items are rendered as the children of the dropdown.

```typescript
dropdown: LayoutItems[]
```

## key
Dropdown items can be used as a target for other items. See `moveToKey` in Common.

```typescript
key?: string
```
